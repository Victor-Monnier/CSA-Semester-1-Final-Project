Created by Victor Monnier for a CSA Semester 1 final project.
I started work in October for setting up basic systems, but I started creating the game toward its present form in late December.

Make sure to run the executable in the same folder as the src folder so it can access /src/data/settings.txt

Ways to run:
-Double click .jar file
-Open terminal, navigate to proper folder, and run "-java jar Semester1Project.jar"
-If this doesn't work, compile from source

Thank you all for your love and passionate support in this project :pray:
:D
