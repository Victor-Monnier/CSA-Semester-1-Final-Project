Created by Victor Monnier for a CSA Semester 1 final project.
Make sure to run the executable in the same folder as the src folder so it can access /src/data/settings.txt

Methods to run:
-Double click .jar file
-Open terminal, navigate to proper folder, and run "-java jar Semester1Project.jar"
-If this doesn't work, compile from source

Thank you all for your love and passionate support in this project :pray:
:D
